# learning-path

i've discovered an invaluable resource for anyone feeling overwhelmed while trying to learn a new topic. check out roadmap.sh, a site i stumbled upon that inspired me to create my own guide focused on the subjects i'm learning

i'm excited to make this project open to the community, allowing others to access well-organized content with ease. i hope you find these learning paths helpful and empowering in your educational journey ðŸ™‚
